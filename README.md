# SubSoniChrome

- Author: Aaron Bieber

## About
SubSoniChrome is the new version of [my Chrome
Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bdebkkdipomhlhnmgdcdjjnifpealoki) for
[SubSonic](http://www.subsonic.org).  My previous version was just a
"bookmark" to the <user>.subsonic.org ( or other url's ).  This new
version aims to be a full blown player.

## Done
- Multiple server support.

## TODO
- layout player interface
- finish code to pull album / artist / song info
- get player playing
- setup preferences page
